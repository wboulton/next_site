# NEXT website
This repository contains an in-development next application that may replace my react app on AWS. Currently, I have a react app running my personal [website](http://williamboulton.com/) which you can see [here](https://github.com/wboulton/personalsite/tree/main/public_website). I am writing this full next.js application to learn more full-stack web development and explore javascript/typescript. If you want to run this app locally simply run
```bash
npm run dev
```
in the project root.
